-- DEFENSE: Using 'SERIAL' automatically creates a unique, increasing ID.
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS groups (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL
);

-- DEFENSE: Foreign key 'group_id' links to the 'groups' table.
-- ON DELETE SET NULL means if a group is deleted, the contact stays but loses the group.
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS contacts (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100),
    birthday DATE,
    group_id INTEGER REFERENCES groups(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- DEFENSE: 'ON DELETE CASCADE' means if a contact is deleted, all their phones are deleted automatically.
-- CHECK ensures 'type' can only be one of the three allowed values.
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS phones (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    contact_id INTEGER REFERENCES contacts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    phone VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    type VARCHAR(10) CHECK (type IN ('home', 'work', 'mobile'))
);
